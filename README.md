# Line Slicer? <finish>
This repository contains the source code for an attempted 24-hour solo game jam submission hosted at my university by Hack Sussex. 

Line slicer is the generic name I made for the game which I attempted to create in this 24 hours, unfortunately falling short of my aims and being abandoned.

# The Vision
The vision for this game was as a 2D slicing rhythm game. Players would slash their way through objects called 'gates' in a manner similar to Fruit Ninja.
These gates would need to be sliced in rhythm with a provided song, which would create gameplay style similar to osu!: rewarding well-timed slices, and punishing misses or badly timed slices.

All around, I had a pretty solid idea of what I wanted to do for this, as it's a form of gameplay I've wanted in osu! for a while.

# The Execution
I chose to use pygame in this project as I was very confident in my python skills, and had heard of pygame as a game development system using python. Development began, with me pretty much picking up pygame as 
I went along. I quickly found that pygame was not as easy to use as I first expected, with it being more of a barebones game framework, rather than a fully fledged game engine. I honestly don't know what I expected from it,
but I was rather surprised by how barebones it actually was, giving me memories of using JavaFX while learning java.

Development continued into the night with several redbulls being drank. Assets were heavily leaning into the "programmer art" style and I was mainly focussing on making a proof of concept.

# Issues encountered
 This would be a major mistake, as pygame kind of sucks, and isn't built **at all** for rhythm based games. Pygame feels more like a set of basic tools to allow people to put barebone 




# Lessons Learned
Honestly, the story of using pygame for something and then finding out it's crap is a story i've heard many
